  <p>
    Research and statistics show scary numbers on how much customer data gets leaked from companies. We will be
    surprised when we hear about the largest bank heist in history, the Bangladesh Bank breach, when they lost $81
    million!
  </p>
<p>
  The funny fact is that they just did not lose money because of the massive breach and how it was executed. Their
  reputation also wallows in the ground, and they are no longer trusted, which leads to losing more than $81 million in
  the future (= no customers)!
</p>

<p>Note: The hackers executed the attack using email attachments that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>Maybe that is not enough. But what about big companies like Uber when teenage hackers breached their data?</p>

<p>
  The hacker did his reconnaissance, found a sysadmin’s phone number, and flooded the victim with MFA push requests in
  the middle of the night until the targeted Uber employee accepted them.
</p>

<p>
  The breach had financial implications for Uber. It not only incurred costs related to investigating and addressing the
  breach but also faced potential fines and legal settlements. Moreover, the drop in user engagement and tarnished
  reputation could have affected its business performance and valuation.
</p>

<p>Now let us take a deep breath and go deep into these incidents. We will notice:</p>
<p class="">In the bank data breach...</p>
<ul class="list-tracing">
  <li class="">The network of the bank was not separated (if one network gets hacked, the rest will be).</li>
  <li class="">Hackers can easily break it and redirect millions to their own private accounts.</li>
  <li class="">Microsoft’s security bulletins had already addressed the risks of this vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Uber data breach...</p>
<ul class="list-tracing">
  <li>Lax governance on admin credentials and MFA management</li>
  <li>The original employee was vished—a type of targeted spear phishing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  From vulnerable firewall technology and insecure software in use to social engineering, the right penetration testing
  solution could have discovered these risks proactively!
</p>

<p>Penetration testing can stop preventable breaches from taking down a major enterprise!</p>

<p>PTaaS has emerged in recent years as a strong offensive security lifeline that can measurably reduce risks.</p>

<p>
  PTaaS enables organizations to perform a penetration test daily, or even after each code change. You will facilitate
  more frequent testing across all environments.
