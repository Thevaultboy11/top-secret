  <h2>Why should you care about security?</h2>

  <p>
    In today's day and age, many developers face major challenges with black-hat hackers. To fortify your application's
    defenses, employ these three simple, yet effective tricks that can significantly stop attackers and enhance your
    app's security posture.

  <h2>Emulator Detection</h2>

{' '}

<p>
  What is an emulator? An emulator is a special program or device that copies the way one computer system works so that
  software designed for that system can run on a different one. Emulator detection is a security technique that helps
  figure out if a program is running on an emulator or a real device, which makes the system more secure and
  trustworthy.

{' '}

<p>Here is a tool that can help you implement this feature.</p>

  <h2>Root Detection</h2>

{' '}

<p>
  Root detection is crucial for app security, as rooted devices can bypass security measures and potentially compromise
  sensitive data. However, with the proliferation of root bypass methods, relying solely on one root detection check has
  become ineffective. To maintain the integrity of your app, it's essential to adopt a multi-layered approach that
  combines various root detection techniques.
</p>

{' '}

<p>There are 3 main tools you could use:</p>

{' '}

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Root Inspector</strong> - a powerful GitHub project that provides an easy-to-use interface for analyzing and
    inspecting root files in various operating systems.

      Link
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Free rasp</strong> - a comprehensive GitHub project that offers a collection of libraries and tools for
    detecting and managing root access on Android devices. They have a well-documented step-by-step instructions.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Root Beer</strong> - a new tool used to secure your application in various ways against rooting. There are 9
    checkups the tool uses to spot a rooted device.

  <h2>Implementing Frida Detection</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>DetectFrida</strong> - a GitHub project that provides a method to identify and detect the usage of named
      pipes by the popular dynamic instrumentation framework, Frida.

    <strong>The easy way or the hard way? The choice is yours...</strong>

  You could try implementing and learning these vulnerabilities alone, struggle and maybe not even know what
  vulnerabilities are present in your application. Or you could find a mentor, (talk to people that have already are in the cyber security industry)
